 * @note:
 * This program is designed to recreate the famous game of life simulation.
 * 
 * Each cell abides by these 4 rules*
 * 		1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
 * 		2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * 		3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 * 		4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

How to Run:
- once you pull this into your IDE you can export as a runnable .jar fil.
- Then you can select this program as the runnable and export.
- Once in you will see the main screen with 3 buttons
- you can start to click bockes on the main screen and press start to watch the simulation.
- At anytime you can selct pause and reset to start over or add more lifde to the simulation.

***Disclaimer
This app idea is not mmy own and was first created by John Conway.
There are in fact better veriosn of this simulation available, this was a
ffun project to work on but i take no credit for intellectual properties.
